## Dosa : Database of Simple Appends

Redoing this in Python - easier to import base level packages (csv, json), very readable and most young devs dabble with python once at the very least.

Aim: Walk you through the depth of databases, without overwhelming you.

### Todo
- [ ] Migrate all notes
- [ ] Implement some level of RAID
- [ ] Implement B+ indexing
- [ ] Implement the joins
- [ ] Instead of brute forcing SQL, implement it using relational algebra
